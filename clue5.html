      I said I needed a shower. You sat on the toilet, watching.<br>
      Not just my body, but my being.<br>
      And in your smile, I felt something I never had before.<br>
      Not  only desire or lust, but love, pure love.<br>
      You didn't look away. You saw me.<br>
      And I that was the moment I finally felt whole.

      That night was perfect. It was honest.<br>
      It was unforgettable, It was you and me and nothing else in the entire world.

      The restaurant was closed. But we had the world in a bed,<br>
      with food and laughter, I knew i found my home.

    <div class="text">
      I thought you weren't hungry. I worried.<br>
      But you'd already gone, eaten alone, and come back to hold me again as i sleep.<br>
      That's love too, quiet, guilty, sweet.
